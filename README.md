## Description

Projects play a key role in our journey to become full stack developers, as a full stack developer it is imperitive to be able to work collaboratively with other developers. With this body of work we aim to showcase how we can seemlessly come together as a whole and work towards a common goal.

As a group we initially came together to solve a problem. We decided on developing an app with log in credentials to display a work out routine specific to the logged in user based on either the default work outs provided, or user created.

## User Story
